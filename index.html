    <h3>Why should you Invest?</h3>
    <p>Since the 1970s, the S&P 500 has been in a generally upward trend. Including dividends, the annual returns have been 10-11%. If you keep reinvesting your dividends, you will continue making more and more money. It is a safe way to make passive income rather than to keep your money in the bank, where it continually loses value due to inflation. The interest the bank pays you will not make up for the money you lose to inflation, whereas investing in index funds such as the S&P 500 will.</p>
