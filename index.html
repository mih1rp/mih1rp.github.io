  <h3>Why should you Invest?</h3>
  <p>Since the 1970s, the S&P 500 has been in an generally upward trend. Including dividends, the annual returns have been 10-11%. If you keep reinvesting your dividends, you will continue making more and more money. It is a safe way to make passive income rather than to keep your money at the bank in which it continually loses money due to inflation. The interest the bank pays you will not make up for the money you lose to inflation whereas investing in index funds such as the S&P 500 will. </p>
